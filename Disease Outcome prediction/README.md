Disease Outcome Prediction is a burgeoning field that amalgamates healthcare and data analytics, offering a transformative approach to predicting and managing diseases. This abstract provides an overview of a user-friendly application incorporating Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest Neighbor algorithms for prognostic disease prediction. The application, built using Python's Tkinter library, allows users to input patient symptoms and leverages four distinct machine-learning models for disease prediction. A variety of symptoms matched to distinct diseases make up the training and testing dataset. It helps with a better understanding and interpretation of the results by enabling users to investigate the relationship between diseases and symptoms. The application incorporates a database to store patient data and forecasts, ensuring data traceability and facilitating future study. To sum up, this abstract highlights how models may be included in an intuitive user interface and how these applications might advance predictive disease analytics for better healthcare outcomes. The application enables users to delve deeper into the data through exploration capabilities, fostering a deeper comprehension of the correlation between symptoms and diseases. Additionally, incorporation of a database facilitates data traceability and future analysis, ensuring the system's utility and scalability over time. By emphasizing usability, algorithm diversity, and data management, this application is a noteworthy advancement in prognostic disease analytics. It has a ton of room to grow healthcare outcomes by providing accurate disease predictions and aiding in informed decision-making by healthcare professionals. Overall, this abstract underscores the promising trajectory of building models for data mining into user-friendly interfaces for enhanced healthcare delivery.
